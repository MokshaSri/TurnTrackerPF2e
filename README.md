### PF2E Turn Tracker

Writing a turn tracker as a concrete example to go alongside reading Sandy Metz' POODR. 

This turn tracker should be able to: 
- Let a GM add PCs and NPCs
- Track the health of the PCs and NPCs
- Track conditions on the PCs and NPCs

A PC consists of a: 
- name
- health 
- AC
- saves
- etc
- conditions with counters

It would be fire to be able to upload a pathbuilder JSON of a PC and have all their details
